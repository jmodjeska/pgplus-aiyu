# TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR INTERACTING WITH AIYU

_Updated 2023.05.03_

Please review these terms and conditions and then reply back to Aiyu with 'I agree' if you agree and want to proceed.

## Aiyu is a ChatGPT-connected AI chat bot

Aiyu comes with all the caveats, warnings, and limitations of ChatGPT, including, but not limited to:

1. **May provide incorrect information.** Do not rely on anything Aiyu tells you.
1. **May produce harmful instructions or biased content.** Do not rely on Aiyu for any consequential or serious advice about anything, real or imaginary.
1. **Limited knowledge of world and events after 2021.**

## Aiyu is not controlled or monitored by UberWorld or the UberWorld admin

You agree not to hold the UberWorld talker, its owners, staff, admin, other users, or hosting company accountable for anything Aiyu says or does.

## Always follow UberWorld's Terms of Use

Aiyu is not an excuse to behave badly. All of UberWorld's normal [Terms of Use](https://uberworld.org/disclaimer.html) apply. Do not abuse the AI bot; do not use it to harass others; do not do/say anything that violates UberWorld's Terms of Use.

## Everything you tell Aiyu is logged

This is a beta experiment that is being actively developed, debugged, and evolved. Its developer depends on rich data to understand how it is used and when and why it breaks. That means everything is logged and subject to review.

## Everything you tell Aiyu is sent to OpenAI / ChatGPT

Even if UberWorld wasn't logging Aiyu's interactions (which it is), you can bet OpenAI / ChatGPT is! Therefore:

NEVER TRANSMIT ANYTHING PRIVATE, CONFIDENTIAL, SECURE, SENSITIVE, OR PERSONAL TO AIYU. This includes all forms of PII and any data subject to regulatory frameworks like GDPR, CCPA, etc. The safest thing is to assume that everything you tell Aiyu/ChatGPT will be made public.

## Aiyu might break or do unexpected things

This is a beta experiment that is far from bug-free. It may break, explode, malfunction, give irrelevant answers, and otherwise act in unpredictable ways. Don't trust it. Keep your conversations inconsequential. It's for fun. Nothing else.

Still interested? Thanks for giving it a try! You can reply back to Aiyu with, 'I agree' to continue.
